Erdos-Renyi
The most well-known model for generating random graphs was introduced by Erdos-Renyi model. 
We chose its variant G(n, p) based on connecting nodes randomly, the method was proposed by Edgar Gilbert. 
In an n-nodes graph, every node in it with probability p is connected to another node in the graph.
